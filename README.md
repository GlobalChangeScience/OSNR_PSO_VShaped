# OSNR_PSO_VShaped

The optimal selection of a natural reserve (OSNR) is an optimisation problem
with a binary domain. To solve this problem, the metaheuristic algorithm called
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been chosen. The PSO algorithm has been
designed to solve problems in real domains. Therefore, a transfer method has
been applied that converts the equations with real domains of the PSO algorithm
into binary results that are compatible with the OSNR problem. Four transfer
functions have been tested in four case studies to solve the OSNR problem.
According to the tests carried out, it is concluded that two of the four
transfer functions are apt to solve the problem of optimal selection of a
natural reserve.
